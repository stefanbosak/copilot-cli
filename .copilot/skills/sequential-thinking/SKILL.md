# Sequential Thinking Skill

## Metadata
- **Skill Name**: sequential-thinking
- **Trigger Tag**: `#st`
- **MCP Server**: Built-in reasoning enhancement
- **Category**: Problem Solving

## Description
Use step-by-step reasoning for complex problem-solving. Breaks down complex queries into logical steps with structured thinking process.

## Capabilities
- Multi-step problem decomposition
- Logical reasoning chains
- Complex algorithm design
- Systematic debugging approaches

## Activation
Include `#st` tag in your prompt to activate this skill.

## Usage Examples

### Algorithm Design
```
#st Design an efficient algorithm for finding duplicates in large dataset
```

### Complex Debugging
```
#st Debug why authentication flow fails intermittently
```

### Architecture Planning
```
#st Plan microservices architecture for e-commerce platform
```

## Configuration
MCP server is defined as `sequentialthinking` in `mcp-config.json`.

## Best Practices
- Use for complex, multi-step problems
- Ideal for architectural decisions
- Helpful for debugging complex issues
- Good for algorithm design and optimization

## Limitations
- May increase response time for simple queries
- More verbose output
- Best for complex problems, overkill for simple tasks
