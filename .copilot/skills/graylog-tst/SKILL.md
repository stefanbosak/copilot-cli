# Graylog Test Environment Skill

## Metadata
- **Skill Name**: graylog-tst
- **Trigger Tag**: `#graylog-tst`
- **MCP Server**: Graylog MCP Server (Test)
- **Category**: Log Management (Test Environment)

## Description
Access Graylog test/staging environment for log search, aggregation, and analysis. Use for development debugging, test run log investigation, and staging environment troubleshooting. Logs are organized into **streams** and stored in **indices**. Queries use **Lucene syntax**.

## Capabilities
- Search test/staging log messages using Lucene query syntax
- Aggregate logs (group by fields, count, avg, min, max, percentiles, etc.)
- List available streams and scope searches to specific streams
- List indices and index sets (data retention configuration)
- List configured inputs (syslog, GELF, etc.)
- Discover available fields per stream (`list_fields`) before querying
- Get current server time and system status

## Key Concepts
- **Streams**: Named partitions of log data (e.g., by app, environment, source). Always scope searches to streams for performance.
- **Indices**: Physical storage units; use `list_indices` to check data availability and health.
- **Fields**: Field names vary per stream. Always call `list_fields` first to discover valid field names before building queries.
- **Lucene syntax**: Queries use Lucene (e.g., `level:ERROR AND source:api-server`). Leading wildcards are disabled by default.

## Activation
Include `#graylog-tst` tag in your prompt to activate this skill.

## Usage Examples

### Log Search
```
#graylog-tst Search for authentication errors in test environment last hour
```

### Aggregate by Error Type
```
#graylog-tst Show top 10 error types in staging grouped by source
```

### Discover Fields First
```
#graylog-tst List available fields in the staging application stream
```

### Combined Analysis
```
#graylog-tst #fetch Analyze error patterns in test logs
```

## Configuration
Do NOT search the filesystem for `mcp-config.json` or similar files directly.
Do NOT read `.copilot/mcp-config.json` directly — always route through custom agent file.
MCP server is configured in the `graylog-tst.agent.md` custom agent file.

## Environment Variables
Use environment variables defined in `.copilot/.env`.

## Connectivity Check
**Before taking any action**, verify the Graylog Test MCP server is reachable:
1. Call `get_system_status` as a lightweight probe.
2. If the call fails or returns an error, immediately stop and report: *"Graylog test MCP server is unavailable. Cannot proceed."*
3. Only proceed with the user's request after a successful probe response.

## Best Practices
- **Always call `list_streams` first** to get stream IDs, then scope searches using `streams` parameter
- **Always call `list_fields` before querying** to discover valid field names for the target stream
- Use `aggregate_messages` instead of `search_messages` for counting/grouping
- Pass time range as `range_seconds` parameter — never embed time in the query string
- Avoid leading wildcards in Lucene queries (disabled by default)

## Limitations
- Test environment only — data does not reflect production
- Different data retention policies than production
- Leading wildcards are disabled in Lucene queries
- Requires proper authentication

## Environment Isolation
**CRITICAL**: Never use `#graylog-tst` and `#graylog-prd` in the same request. Choose one environment per query.
